# Shattered Veil — Chronicles of the Rift

A rich, single-page browser RPG with a 300×300 procedurally-generated world, 16 classes, 8 Bloodmarks, 5 Covenants, 7 Ranks, 16 elements, towns, rifts, turn-based combat, spellbooks, pets, equipment, dynasty succession, relic crafting, and story quests — all in one React component.

## Run & Operate

- `pnpm --filter @workspace/shattered-veil run dev` — run the game (workflow: `artifacts/shattered-veil: web`)
- `pnpm run typecheck` — full typecheck across all packages
- `pnpm run build` — typecheck + build all packages

## Stack

- pnpm workspaces, Node.js 24, TypeScript 5.9
- Game: React 18 + Vite 7 (port from `PORT` env, default 21515)
- No backend — localStorage saves (3 slots)
- Fonts: Cinzel (headers), Crimson Text (body narrative), Nunito (UI)

## Where things live

- `artifacts/shattered-veil/src/Game.jsx` — entire game logic + JSX (~7200 lines)
- `artifacts/shattered-veil/src/game.css` — complete visual stylesheet (~1080 lines), parchment/navy/crimson aesthetic
- `artifacts/shattered-veil/src/App.tsx` — renders `<Game />`
- `artifacts/shattered-veil/src/main.tsx` — React entry point

## Architecture decisions

- Single massive component: all game state (player, map, battle, UI) lives in one `Game` component using many `useState`/`useCallback`/`useMemo` hooks.
- Theme object `T` controls inline style colors throughout: parchment palette (`bg:#f5ead0`, `tx:#18120a`, etc.) for non-battle screens; battle screen forced dark via `!important` CSS.
- No build-time CSS-in-JS — theme colors are applied inline via JSX, with `.game.css` setting structural/layout rules and using `!important` to override inline styles for context-specific sections (`.battle-bg`, `.hud-shell`).
- Map: 300×300 tile grid (90000 tiles), biome-based generation, stored in state.
- Saves: JSON-serialized to `localStorage` (`sv_save_0/1/2`).

## Game Systems (v28)

### Bloodmarks
- 8 fantasy lineage traits: Veil-Veined, Stormborn, Ashblood, Ironblooded, Rootbound, Voidtouched, Goldensoul, Mirrorborn
- Defined in `BLOODMARKS` array (~line 270), helpers `getBM(id)`
- Applied in `projectedEffStatsFor` (stat bonuses) and on passive-check hooks in battle
- Chosen at character creation (step 2 of 3-step flow)
- **Inherited by heirs** at succession with ~1-in-7 chance of mutation
- Displayed in HUD badge + Stats panel card

### Ranks
- 7 progression tiers: Wanderer → Acolyte → Disciple → Seeker → Warden → Archon → Fractured
- Defined in `RANKS` array (~line 283), helpers `getRank(level)` / `getNextRankLevel(level)`
- Rank-up triggered in `giveXP` level-up loop; applies bonus stats directly to `pl.st`
- Displayed in HUD badge + Stats panel card with level milestone

### Covenants
- 5 factions: Veilwatch, Iron Crown, Embersong Circle, Silkweb Guild, Tidecall Conclave
- Defined in `COVENANTS` array (~line 294), helper `getCV(id)`
- Applied in `projectedEffStatsFor` (stat bonuses)
- Joined/renounced at the **Covenant Hall** town service (200G to renounce)
- Each generation starts without a covenant — must pledge anew
- Displayed in HUD badge + Stats panel card

### Relic Crafting
- 8 recipes using shards and fragments → consumable items
- Available at the **Relic Crafting** town service
- Recipes: Veil Tonic, Mana Crystal, Elixir of Iron, Void Draught, Cleansing Dust, Repel Incense, War Talisman, Void Shard Bomb

## Visual Aesthetic (Veilbound-inspired)

- **Background**: Deep navy/void starfield with crimson + gold aurora glows
- **Panels**: Parchment gradient cards (`#f5ead0 → #ecdfc0`) with tan borders and dark ink text
- **HUD**: Always dark navy (overrides parchment context via `!important`)
- **Battle screen**: Dark navy/void with crimson borders, forced via `!important` on `.battle-bg .cd`
- **Fonts**: Cinzel 900 for titles, Cinzel 600 for section headers, Crimson Text for narrative, Nunito for UI

## User preferences

- Visual style: parchment + navy + crimson (Veilbound-inspired)
- Keep single-artifact architecture — all in one `Game.jsx`
- JJK-flavor lore (innate techniques, sorcerer grades, domain expansions / unfolded territory) but kept subtle — no curse-energy or curse-user terminology
- End goal is a multiplayer PvP adventure — design new systems with PvP in mind even while single-player remains the default

## Story Quests (v29)

11-quest spine, presented in playable order in the Codex. New JJK-flavored milestones:
- `s8` Schoolyard Assessment — pledge a Covenant + win 3 sanctioned duels
- `s9` Echoes Across the Veil — win 5 Duelist's Circle matches
- `s10` The Inherited Technique — reach Warden grade + bloodmark expressions
- `s11` Unfolded Territory — survive a domain expansion encounter
The original `s7` Dream Devourer remains the final chapter.

## Duelist's Circle (PvP-prep)

Town service `duel` (icon 🤺) — sanctioned 1-on-1 sparring vs an AI sorcerer. Tracks `pl.duelTier` (0+) which scales opponent level and reward (gold/XP/relic shard). Wins also progress `s8` (when player has a Covenant) and `s9` story quests. Architecture sketch for live PvP:
- Same client-side battle engine, same `startBattle([e], "duel")` entrypoint — only the opponent payload changes (AI rolled now, real-player snapshot later)
- Server contract (TBD): match request with `{ tier, covenant, level }` → returns opponent snapshot `{ class, stats, skills, bloodmark }`
- Result POST: `{ winnerId, turns, finalEf, opponentId }` for ladder/rank updates
- Free tier: client-side only for now — UI explicitly says "matchmaking when PvP servers are live"

## Visual assets

- `public/title-veil.png` — painted hero artwork (cloaked sorcerer, torn veil sky, glowing runes) used as the title screen background. Layered under a darkening gradient so the UI text remains readable. Generated 2026-05-07.
- `public/town-square.png` — twilight town backdrop, currently unused, available for future town/inn redesign.
- `public/class/<id>.png` — 21 unique painted class portraits (one per CLS entry: paladin, assassin, sorcerer, priest, ranger, koen, shouei, phoenix, chrono, dream, voidmage, rune, bard, gravity, sound, puppet, tide, monk, primal, hexblade, gambler). Used in the class-pick grid (32×32 thumbnails) and Identity step (96×96 hero card). Wired via `import.meta.env.BASE_URL + "class/" + id + ".png"` so the URL works under any artifact path prefix.

## Forge Your Hero contrast (v30)

Inline `T.c1`/`T.c2` (parchment) backgrounds on cards inside `.create-bg` were defeating the dark-navy `.cd` baseline and making yellow/light-blue text unreadable. All class cards, bloodmark cards, name/quote inputs, and the interaction preview buttons now force a dark navy gradient with light text (`#e8eeff` body, `#cfd6ee` labels, class color for headers). Personal Quote is now **required** alongside Hero Name to begin — Begin button stays disabled until both are filled, with a poetic prompt under the button when the quote is empty.

## Gotchas

- `Game.jsx` exceeds Babel's 500KB deoptimization threshold — HMR is slower than normal, be patient after edits.
- Battle screen colors must use `!important` in CSS to override inline `T.*` parchment colors.
- `hud-shell` must use `!important` — it's inside `.shell-bg .cd` which would otherwise apply parchment styling.
- `startSuccession` must be declared before line ~3550 (was a TDZ bug when first migrated).
- `index.css` is intentionally minimal — no Tailwind (the original template had placeholder `red` values).
- The local `covenant` useState (line ~3034) is declared but the live covenant is tracked inside `pl.covenant` — safe to leave as-is.
